VorbisPizza
-------

VorbisPizza is a fork of the [NVorbis](https://github.com/NVorbis/NVorbis) library for decoding Xiph.org Vorbis files.  
This fork is built for modern .NET and has mostly the same API as NVorbis.

This implementation is based on the Vorbis specification found on xiph.org.  
MDCT and Huffman code was borrowed from public domain implementations in https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c.
